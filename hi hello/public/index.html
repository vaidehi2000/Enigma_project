<p><h2><b><font face="Lucida Sans Unicode"><center>Hello and welcome to The Enigma Project!</center></b></h2></p></font>
<p align="center"><font face="Lucida sans unicode" size="3">This is a project started after realizing the magnitude of food wastage in the modern world<br>
Here, we have a network of pickup vans in a locality that collect the leftover food from your house <br>
and other houses in your locality and donate it to the people who need it more.<br>
we give you an opportunity to not waste the daily leftover food and give it to the needy through <br>
this user friendly website where you can call in the food pickup car just by a click on your mouse!<br>
You can save somebody's life by the following these 3 simple steps:
<ul type="bullet">
<li>click the donate button at the end of this page
<li>enter your name,phone number and address &#40these will not be shared with anyone else!&#41
<li>click the &quot submit &quot button to place your order
</ul> 
And thats it! our driver will come and pickup the food you have!</p> </font>
<font size="2"><p>but the following minimum requirements have to be satisfied:
<ul type="bullet">
<li>your food must not be stale
<li>you shall be banned from this programme if it is found that<br>you donate stale/poisoned &#40 knowingly or unknowingly &#41 food.
